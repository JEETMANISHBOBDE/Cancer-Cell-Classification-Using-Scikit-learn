# Cancer-Cell-Classification-Using-Scikit-learn
This project is about classifying cancer cells as malignant or benign using machine learning. I used the Breast Cancer Wisconsin dataset, which is a well-known dataset for this type of binary classification task.

What’s Inside?

Dataset: The data comes from Scikit-learn's built-in datasets. It includes features derived from digitized images of breast tissue samples.
Machine Learning Model: I used a Random Forest Classifier to predict whether a sample is malignant or benign.
Evaluation: The notebook includes metrics like accuracy and a detailed classification report (precision, recall, F1-score).
How to Use

Clone this repository to your local machine:
git clone https://github.com/your-username/cancer-cell-classification.git
cd cancer-cell-classification
Make sure you have the required libraries installed:
pip install -r requirements.txt
Open the Cancer_Cell_Classification.ipynb file in Jupyter Notebook, Google Colab, or any other compatible environment and run the cells.
Output

The notebook provides:

Accuracy: Shows how well the model performed on the test set.
Classification Report: A breakdown of performance metrics for both classes (malignant and benign).
Why This Project?

I wanted to work on a project that blends machine learning and healthcare. This dataset seemed like a perfect starting point to experiment with classification models and evaluate their performance in a real-world context.
